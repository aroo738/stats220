# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Data Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it a course that builds on foundations of R that I have learnt through other papers.
- I am interested in learning about more skills involving data wrangling and visualisations, improving my profiency in using R.
